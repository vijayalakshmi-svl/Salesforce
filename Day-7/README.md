# 🚀 Day 7 – Building Software That Survives Scale

## Salesforce Placement Management System

---

# 📖 Overview

Day 7 focuses on designing scalable Salesforce applications capable of processing hundreds of records efficiently.

This chapter introduces **Governor Limits**, **Bulkification**, **Collection Thinking**, and the **Trigger Handler Pattern**. These concepts help developers write Apex code that performs well even when processing large batches of records.
