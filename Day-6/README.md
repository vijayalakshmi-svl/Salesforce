# 📖 Overview

The **Placement Management System** is an enterprise Salesforce application developed to automate and streamline campus placement activities.

This sprint focuses on **Apex Triggers**, **Enterprise Trigger Architecture**, and the **Service Layer Pattern**, ensuring that business logic remains modular, reusable, and maintainable.

Instead of placing all logic inside Apex Triggers, the project delegates business operations to dedicated Service Classes following Salesforce best practices.
